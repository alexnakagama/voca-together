# 011: Registration (M1 step 4)

> **Status:** in force.
>
> **Changed later:** 018 closed the deferral at the end (rate limits, bounded email sends) and added
> `Cache-Control: no-store`; 019 chose Resend; 020 reworded the account-exists email to name Google too.
>
> **Current rules:** `.claude/rules/auth.md`, `.claude/rules/backend.md` (API conventions).

- `POST /v1/auth/register` answers 202 `{"status":"accepted"}` for a new **and** an existing address. The existing
  account is left untouched (no password change, no new token) and its owner gets the "account exists" email.
  Both paths hash the password and send email in the background, so timing doesn't reveal accounts either.
- User and verification token are inserted in one transaction (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on the email, so concurrent
  sign-ups for one address are safe). Email is sent only after commit.
- Verification links expire after **24 hours** (DB clock). Tokens use `NewToken("")`, without a prefix.
- Error responses: `{"error":{"code":"…"}}`; `validation_failed` (422) adds `"fields":[{"field":"…","code":"…"}]`
  with all failing fields. Malformed JSON, unknown fields, trailing data or a body over 8 KiB: 400
  `invalid_request`. Anything else: 500 `internal_error`, details only in server logs.
- **If the email fails after commit**, the failure is logged (kind and error only) and the response stays 202;
  there is no retry. The unverified account remains and the user recovers with resend-verification, which replaces
  the token. Durable delivery (an outbox) is deferred.
- Production never uses `LogSender` (007); it sends through Resend (019).
- **Deferred to the rate-limiting/hardening step:** registration can be abused to send email to any address
  (email bombing) and to spend argon2 CPU and memory (19 MiB per hash); background sends aren't capped either.
