# 012: Email verification and resend (M1 step 5)

> **Status:** in force.
>
> **Changed later:** 017 and 019 built the pages; 018 added rate limits and the cleanup of old token rows,
> which closes the deferrals at the end.
>
> **Current rules:** `.claude/rules/auth.md` (it states the lock order this decision introduced).

- `POST /v1/auth/verify-email` `{"token"}` → 200 `{"status":"verified"}`. It never creates a session: login stays a
  separate step. Every unusable token (malformed, unknown, expired, used, other purpose) gets the same 422
  `validation_failed` with `{"field":"token","code":"invalid"}`, so responses reveal nothing about token history.
  Malformed tokens are rejected before any database access.
- **Used tokens are rejected, even for verified accounts** (not reported as success). Single use stays a uniform
  rule, and an old link can't reveal an account's state. Double clicks are harmless (GET never consumes, see 006);
  clients say "invalid or already used, try logging in". If a live token ever reaches an already verified account,
  consuming it succeeds and keeps the original `email_verified_at`.
- `POST /v1/auth/resend-verification` `{"email"}` → 202 `{"status":"accepted"}` for unknown, unverified and verified
  addresses alike. Only an unverified account gets a new token (the old one is deleted, 004) and an email, sent in the
  background after commit. Nothing else is written or sent, and the password is never touched.
- **Lock order:** a transaction that changes an existing user's `user_tokens` rows first locks the `users` row
  (`FOR UPDATE`). Verification, resend and (later) password reset follow it, so they serialize per account and
  can't deadlock. Token consumption itself is still the conditional `UPDATE` of 004; the lock only orders.
  Consequences: concurrent uses of one token succeed once; a resend makes a concurrently submitted old token fail;
  a resend that waits for a verification sees the account verified and does nothing; concurrent resends leave
  exactly one live token (the last one emailed).
- No migration was needed; the 001 schema already has everything.
- Accepted timing difference: resend for an unverified account does one DELETE and one INSERT more than for other
  addresses (well under network jitter); email is sent in the background in all cases.
- **Deferred:** rate limiting (resend can mail any unverified account repeatedly: email bombing, together with
  register); the HTML pages behind emailed links (006; reset page in 017, verify page in 019); cleanup of used and expired
  token rows.
