# 010: Email addresses are restricted to printable ASCII

> **Status:** in force.

- Addresses are trimmed and lowercased, and must be a plain `local@domain` in printable ASCII: no display names,
  quoted local parts, comments, IP-literal domains, or domains whose final label is all digits.
- Why ASCII-only:
  - **Delivery:** non-ASCII addresses need SMTPUTF8 support end to end, which email providers support unevenly.
    Verification is mandatory, so an address we can't reliably email can't complete signup.
  - **Look-alikes:** Unicode confusables (Cyrillic `а` vs Latin `a`) would allow distinct accounts that look identical.
  - **Canonicalization:** Unicode addresses have several normalization and case-folding forms, so one mailbox could
    map to several stored strings, i.e. duplicate accounts.
- Header-injection safety comes from rejecting whitespace and control characters, not from the ASCII restriction.
- Cost: users whose address contains non-ASCII characters can't register. Users of internationalized domains can
  still type the domain's ASCII (punycode) form (`ana@xn--espaa-rta.es`). Clients must show a clear message.
- Possible later relaxation: accept Unicode domains by converting them to punycode (`golang.org/x/net/idna`) before
  storing. Non-ASCII local parts only if a real need appears.
